# IC Photography Styles

[IC Photography Styles](https://github.com/MYTE21/IC.Photography.Styles) is a fascinating and cutting-edge machine learning project that aims to identify and distinguish between a broad spectrum of photographic styles. This project can recognize and categorize 25 different types of photographic genres using the most advanced machine learning algorithms. The project is made to automatically assess and categorize photographs based on their distinctive photographic style, from landscape and portrait photography to abstract and fine art photography.

In-depth knowledge of the complexities and subtleties of photography was used to build IC Photography Styles.
An intelligent system
that accurately distinguishes various photographic types was developed by the team after thorough research.
An enormous dataset of pictures from all across the world was used to train the system.

With its cutting-edge features and complex technology,
IC Photography Styles will certainly alter the way we evaluate and classify photographs.
This project is certain to give you insightful knowledge about the various kinds of photography styles available,
whether you're a professional photographer
seeking to improve your craft or a photography enthusiast wanting to explore the world of photography.
Why not try it out for yourself right now and discover what the future of photography holds?

## Project Overview

[IC Photography Styles'](https://github.com/MYTE21/IC.Photography.Styles) primary goal is
to offer an automated method for classifying and identifying various photographic styles.
The project explores significant visual aspects in photographs
by utilizing the strength of machine learning techniques and placing them in one of the 25 categories listed below:

1. **Natural World Photography**
    1. Landscape Photography
    2. Wildlife Photography
    3. Underwater Photography
    4. Astrophotography
    5. Storm Photography
    6. Pet Photography
    7. Macro Photography
    8. Flower Photography
2. **Cityscapes and Structures Photography**
    1. Architecture Photography
    2. Real estate Photography
3. **People Photography**
    1. Portrait Photography
    2. Event Photography
    3. Fashion Photography
    4. Sports Photography
    5. Documentary Photography
4. **Lifestyle Photography**
    1. Street Photography
    2. Wedding Photography
5. **Commercial Photography**
    1. Food Photography
    2. Product Photography
6. **Artistic Photography**
    1. Still Life Photography
    2. Black and White Photography
    3. Fine Art Photography
    4. Double Exposure Photography
    5. Surreal Photography
    6. Abstract Photography


## How It Works

[IC Photography Styles](https://github.com/MYTE21/IC.Photography.Styles) uses sophisticated machine learning methods,
in particular deep learning models,
to categorize and identify the photography styles visible in photos.
In order to train the model,
the project uses an extensive labeled dataset of several photos reflecting various photographic approaches.
Extensive training enables the model to recognize the unique traits and patterns that define each style,
allowing for precise classification of styles.

## Get Started

To get started with the IC Photography Styles project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: [link-to-github-repo]
2. Set up the required dependencies and libraries as mentioned in the project documentation.
3. Obtain a dataset of images representing the 25 photography styles or use the provided sample dataset.
4. Train the machine learning model using the dataset and the provided training scripts.
5. Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify and recognize photography styles in new images.
